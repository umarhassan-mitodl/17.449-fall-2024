### Course Meeting Times

Seminars: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

### Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for this course.

### Course Overview

How will emerging technologies – including drones, artificial intelligence, genome editing, additive manufacturing, and cyber warfare – affect international security? Will these technologies shape when and how states use military force? How do states develop these technologies, and how do they diffuse? Specifically, what obstacles do states face when acquiring these technologies and incorporating them into their arsenals? What ethical and legal quandaries do decisionmakers confront when contemplating the development and use of new military systems? Drawing from scholarly research and the latest policy debates, we will explore how new technologies impact the security environment of the world in which we live.

This course is designed for undergraduate students with an interest in international relations, security studies, or the military application of emerging technologies. The course will frame discussion of new technologies using international relations theories about the causes and conduct of war and will draw from social science research to examine the effects of these technologies. Because of this, some background in international relations theory and/or political science methodology (e.g., {{% resource_link "f06640ac-2105-4925-b772-1af17547e7d9" "*17.41 Introduction to International Relations*" %}}) will be helpful, but not required. Throughout the course, students will engage with writing by scholars and practitioners, hear from subject matter experts, participate in a simulation (wargame), and develop their own arguments about the effect of emerging technologies on international security in written assignments.

Students should come away from the class with a solid theoretical foundation of the causes and consequences of technological innovation in the international security domain, and understand various methods that scholars and policymakers use to test these theories. Students hoping to pursue careers in science and technology will ideally leave the class with a deeper understanding of how the systems they develop might impact the global security environment. Similarly, students interested in public policy will ideally be better equipped to develop strategies to manage the development and use of emerging technologies.

### Requirements

*Reading and Participation (20% of the final course grade)*

This course will be discussion-based, with significant interaction between the instructor and students. I will typically open each class with a discussion of key concepts, but will then pose questions that allow us to critically engage with the assigned readings. A successful class therefore requires active participation by all members. Accordingly, you will be expected to complete all required readings before class.

The syllabus is generally structured so that each week features a mix of readings on international relations theory and on military technological innovation (from both scholarly and policy outlets). This will enable us to assess whether and how well existing theoretical logics explain the effects of emerging technologies in the security domain.

During class discussions students should be prepared not to simply summarize the readings, but to critique and build upon the authors’ arguments. For instance, students might raise questions about the conditions under which a specific argument is valid. They might also draw connections across readings from a given week or from previous weeks. Or, they might critically assess the evidence an author uses to justify their claims and/or propose creative ways to test theoretical arguments.

Although our opinions on the topics covered in the course may differ, mutual respect is critical to a successful seminar. Students are expected to arrive to class on time, actively listen to their classmates, and critically (but respectfully) engage with their classmates, instructor, and the assigned readings.

Participation will be evaluated based on attendance, the quality and frequency of contributions during class discussions and participation in the crisis simulation. The most successful students will attend all classes, demonstrate comprehension of all readings, raise thought-provoking critiques of assigned material, and introduce ideas or arguments that build upon the assigned readings. The course participation grade will also include student participation in the crisis simulation.

Attendance is mandatory. If you are unable to attend class for a legitimate reason such as illness or a family emergency, please try to notify me ahead of class. Unexcused or repeated absences will lower your participation grade.

*Quizzes \[10%\]*

Two short quizzes will test students on materials covered in lecture and reading. These quizzes, which will feature short answer questions, will be held during the first 15-minutes of class. Quizzes will be held during Sessions 10 and 22.

*Writing and Analysis \[70%\]*

Writing is a critical component of the course. The assignments are designed to help students develop their ability to think critically about issues related to emerging technology, innovation, and international security, conduct independent research, synthesize material, and clearly convey information in well-structured and empirically supported essays.

- Response Paper
- Simulated Shark Tank Pitch 
- In-Class Midterm
- Short-Form Analytic Article (Final Paper)

### Course Policies

*Mutual Respect*

Although opinions on the topics covered in the course may differ, mutual respect is critical to a successful seminar. Students are expected to arrive to class on time, actively listen to their classmates, and critically (but respectfully) engage with their classmates, instructor, and the assigned readings.

*Academic Integrity*

All students will uphold the highest standards of academic integrity. Presenting the work of others (e.g., ideas, specific phrases, etc.) as your own is considered plagiarism, and will not be tolerated. Any violations will be handled according to MIT policies, which are outlined at {{% resource_link "29e58503-3f21-4bb3-8576-1a6286ebf109" "Academic Integrity at MIT: A Handbook for Students" %}}. The {{% resource_link "536485af-11c2-4f82-ba16-da174a313ad8" "MIT Writing and Communication Center" %}} website has helpful tips on how to avoid plagiarism.
